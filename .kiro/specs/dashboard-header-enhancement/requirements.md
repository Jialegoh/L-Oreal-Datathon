# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the L'Oréal TrendSpotter dashboard by creating an appealing, professional header that incorporates the L'Oréal logo and establishes strong brand identity. The current dashboard lacks a prominent header section that showcases the L'Oréal branding and provides clear navigation context for users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to see a prominent L'Oréal branded header when I access the dashboard, so that I immediately understand this is an official L'Oréal analytics tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a header section at the top of the page
2. WHEN the header is displayed THEN the system SHALL include the L'Oréal logo prominently positioned
3. WHEN the header is rendered THEN the system SHALL use L'Oréal brand colors (#ED1B2E red, #000000 black, #FFFFFF white)
4. WHEN the header appears THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling with the existing dashboard theme

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the header to clearly identify the dashboard purpose and team, so that I understand the context and ownership of the analytics tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the header is displayed THEN the system SHALL show "TrendSpotter" as the main dashboard title
2. WHEN the header is rendered THEN the system SHALL display "AI Glow-Rithms" as the team identifier
3. WHEN the title text is shown THEN the system SHALL use appropriate typography hierarchy and L'Oréal brand fonts
4. IF the header contains multiple text elements THEN the system SHALL arrange them in a visually balanced layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the header to be responsive and professional-looking, so that it works well across different screen sizes and maintains L'Oréal's premium brand image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the header SHALL adapt responsively
2. WHEN the header is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and alignment
3. WHEN the logo is shown THEN the system SHALL ensure it maintains proper aspect ratio and clarity
4. WHEN the header is rendered THEN the system SHALL use subtle shadows or borders to create visual separation from content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a dashboard maintainer, I want the header implementation to be clean and maintainable, so that future updates to branding or content can be easily implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the header code is implemented THEN the system SHALL use reusable CSS classes for styling
2. WHEN the header is created THEN the system SHALL properly reference the existing logo file (loreal-logo.jpeg)
3. WHEN the header styling is applied THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing L'Oréal brand CSS variables
4. IF the header needs updates THEN the system SHALL allow easy modification of text content and styling
